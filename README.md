## API TO CSV TO JSON TO JSONBLOB

- This code is a modular construction that makes requests and gets responses from API endpoints(extraction).
- Transforms the data into csv files, then  to json files(transformation).
- It then dumps the json files into jsonblobs to get jsonblob endpoints that make it easily queriable in Dune(loading).

Poor Man's ETL pipeline lol ðŸ˜…
